Your tactics and strategies will have an even more decisive impact.<br/><br/>You can now change the difficulty level at any time in the Options menu. If you're having a hard time, feel free to retreat and decrease the difficulty until you get the hang of things.<br/><br/>For more details, check out the latest patch notes listing all the difficulty-related changes.</desc>
